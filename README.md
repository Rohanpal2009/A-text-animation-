# A-text-animation-
A simple beggiener friendly text animation generator☺️
How It Works
1. Takes a sample text string "hello world i ama boy"
2. Iterates through each character in the text.
3. For each character, it cycles through all printable characters.
4. When it finds the matching character it-
   · Pauses briefly (0.2 seconds)
   · Prints the current progress
   · Adds the character to the temporary string
5. For non-matching characters, it-
   · Pauses very briefly (0.02 seconds)
   · Shows what appears to be a "searching" animation

Features

· Realistic typing simulation with variable speeds
· Visual feedback showing the "search" for the correct character
· Uses Python's string.printable to access all printable characters

Requirements

· Python 3.x
